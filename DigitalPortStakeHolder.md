## **Feedback**
---

- **_Anonymous person online:_**
"I really like the design, however there's mostly images and not much writing."
 
 I then asked them what do they think I should write more about.

 Their reply was: "Maybe you could talk about who's it aimed at and why do you want the job. You could also talk into more details on each page." 

- **My response:** Based on this feedback, I decided to modify my work by writing down in more details and included some small informations.

Once I improved my digital portfolio, I do prefer this one over the other as it looks more filled in and includes much more information. Which definitely developed to meets the needs of the audiance (potential IT employer).
